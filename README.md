## Abstract
In the booming video era, video segmentation attracts increasing research attention in the multimedia community.

Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims at segmenting objects in all target frames of a video, given annotated object masks of reference frames. **Most existing methods build pixel-wise reference-target correlations and then perform pixel-wise tracking to obtain target masks. Due to neglecting object-level cues, pixel-level approaches make the tracking vulnerable to perturbations, and even indiscriminate among similar objects.**

Towards **robust VOS**, the key insight is to calibrate the representation and mask of each specific object to be expressive and discriminative. Accordingly, we propose a new deep network, which can adaptively construct object representations and calibrate object masks to achieve stronger robustness.

First, we construct the object representations by applying an **adaptive object proxy (AOP) aggregation** method, where the proxies represent arbitrary-shaped segments **via clustering** at multi-levels for reference. 

Then, prototype masks are initially generated from the reference-target correlations based on AOP.
Afterwards, such proto-masks are further calibrated through network modulation, conditioning on the object proxy representations.
We consolidate this **conditional mask calibration** process in a progressive manner, where the object representations and proto-masks evolve to be discriminative iteratively.

Extensive experiments are conducted on the standard VOS benchmarks, YouTube-VOS-18/19 and DAVIS-17. 
Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing published works, and also exhibits significantly superior robustness against perturbations.

## Requirements
* Python3
* pytorch >= 1.4.0 
* torchvision
* opencv-python
* Pillow

You can also use the docker image below to set up your env directly. However, this docker image may contain some redundent packages.

```latex
docker image: xxiaoh/vos:10.1-cudnn7-torch1.4_v3
```

A more light-weight version can be created by modified the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/JerryX1110/RPCMVOS/blob/main/Dockerfile) provided.

## Preparation
* Datasets

    * **YouTube-VOS**

        A commonly-used large-scale VOS dataset.

        [datasets/YTB/2019](datasets/YTB/2019): version 2019, download [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BWzrCWyPEmBEKm0lOHe5KLuBuQxUSwqz?usp=sharing). `train` is required for training. `valid` (6fps) and `valid_all_frames` (30fps, optional) are used for evaluation.

        [datasets/YTB/2018](datasets/YTB/2018): version 2018, download [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bI5J1H3mxsIGo7Kp-pPZU8i6rnykOw7f?usp=sharing). Only `valid` (6fps) and `valid_all_frames` (30fps, optional) are required for this project and used for evaluation.

    * **DAVIS**

        A commonly-used small-scale VOS dataset.

        [datasets/DAVIS](datasets/DAVIS): [TrainVal](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/csergi/share/davis/DAVIS-2017-trainval-480p.zip) (480p) contains both the training and validation split. [Test-Dev](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/csergi/share/davis/DAVIS-2017-test-dev-480p.zip) (480p) contains the Test-dev split. The [full-resolution version](https://davischallenge.org/davis2017/code.html) is also supported for training and evaluation but not required.

* pretrained weights for the backbone

  [resnet101-deeplabv3p](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H3yUShfPqzxSt-nHJP-zYSbbu2o_RQQu/view)


## Implementation

The key implementation of matching with adaptive-proxy-based representation is provided in [THIS FILE](https://github.com/JerryX1110/Robust-Video-Object-Segmentation/blob/main/AOC-Net/adaptive_embedding_for_matching.py). Other implementation and training/evaluation details can refer to [PRCMVOS](https://github.com/JerryX1110/RPCMVOS) or [CFBI](https://github.com/z-x-yang/CFBI).

The key implementation of the preliminary robust VOS benchmark evaluation is provided in [THIS FILE](https://github.com/JerryX1110/Robust-Video-Object-Segmentation/tree/main/Robust-VOS-Benchmark).

The whole project code is provided in [THIS FOLDER](https://github.com/JerryX1110/Robust-Video-Object-Segmentation/tree/main/AOC-Net/complete_project).

Feel free to contact me if you have any problems with the implementation~



* For evaluation, please use official YouTube-VOS servers ([2018 server](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19544) and [2019 server](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20127)), official [DAVIS toolkit](https://github.com/davisvideochallenge/davis-2017) (for Val), and official [DAVIS server](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20516#learn_the_details) (for Test-dev).



## Limitation & Directions for further exploration towards Robust VOS!
* Extension of the proposed clustering-based adaptive proxy representation to other dense-tracking tasks in a more efficient and robust way
* Leverage the robust layered representation, i.e., intermediate masks, for robust mask calibration in other segmentation tasks
* More diverse perturbation/corruption types can be studied for video segmentation tasks like VOS and VIS
* Adversial attack and defence for VOS models is still an open question for further exploration
* VOS model robustness verification and theoretical analysis
* Model enhancement from the perspective of data management
